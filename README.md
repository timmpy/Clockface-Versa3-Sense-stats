# Clockface-Versa3-Sense-stats

This is my first clockface, not yet published to the fitbit gallery.

things to improve:
- More color selections
- circle around the stats with filling the circle depending how far the goal is reached.
- turn off enabling of seconds
- heart-beat icon speed should be some speed as the real heart-beat
- select color of heart-beat icon
- spO2 data and\or sleeping score should be in the stats.
- stress level (number) in the stats... 
- in stats place is still free
- can add another stat in the middle of the bottom (enough place)

This is just my personal wish-list so when I get more knowledge how to do this i hope i'm able to do this. ;-)

this clockface is based on: https://github.com/lincsanders/fitbit_stats_clock
